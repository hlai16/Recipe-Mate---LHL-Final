## Welcome to Recipe Mate!~

Recipe mate is a place to share recipes. Like a cookbook, beyond cooking and booking.
Food and crafting lovers agree that it’s not only about the product, it involves the process. It’s about preparation, dedication and improvement. And by sharing a recipe, is sharing that experience.


### Setup

Install dependencies with `yarn install`. or `npm install` if you don't have yarn.
Git clone Recipe-Mate-Api. This is the server for getting API: https://github.com/C-Swain/Recipe-Mate-Api
*Note: Might need to check the versions of some of the dependencies. Some dependencies might be deduped, and will need to remove the deduped versions. Follow the steps in the terminal if this happens.

Recipe Mate requires both the Api Server and The PSQL database to run.

## Thank you for your interest in our project

This project was made with love as a final project for our Lighthouse Labs Web Development-Bootcamp. 
We came together over a passion of food, creating and coding. We were driven to make something fun and beautiful to use. The Vision is to get people sharing ideas of a platform that embraces creativity and Innovation.
